This can result in periods where expensive resources \\nare sitting idle or occasions of insufficient capacity. With cloud computing, you can \\naccess as much or as little capacity as you need and dynamically scale to meet actual  \\ndemand, while only paying for what you use.  \\nOn AWS, servers, databases, storage, and higher -level application components can be \\ninstantiated within seconds.

This \\nchange in approach encourages experimentation  by introducing the ability in \\nprocesses to fail fast and iterate quickly.  \\nGlobal, Available, and Scalable  Capacity  \\nUsing the global infrastructure  of AWS, you can deploy your application to the AWS \\nRegion that best meets your requirements (e.g., proximity to yo ur end users, \\ncompliance, data residency constraints, and cost).3 For global applications, you can \\nreduce latency to end users around the world by using the Amazon CloudFront content \\ndelivery network  (CDN) .  This also makes it much easier to operate produc tion \\napplications and databases across multiple data centers to achieve high availability and \\nfault tolerance.

Some key design principles of the AWS Cloud \\ninclude scalability, disposable resources, automation, loose coupling managed services \\ninstead of servers, and flexible data storage options.  \\nScalability  \\nSystems that are expected to grow over time need to be built on top of a scalable \\narchitecture. Such an architecture can support growth in users, traffic, or data size \\nwith no drop -in perfor mance. It should provide that scale in a linear manner where \\nadding extra resources results in at least a proportional increase in ability to serve \\nadditional load. Growth should introduce economies of scale, and cost should follow \\nthe same dimension that generates business value out of that system. While cloud \\ncomputing provides virtually unlimited on -demand capacity, your design needs to be \\nable to take advantage of those resources seamlessly.  \\nThere are generally two ways to scale an IT architecture: vert ically and horizontally.  \\nScaling Vertically  \\nScaling vertically takes place through an increase in the specifications of an individual \\nresource, such as upgrading a server with a larger hard drive or a faster CPU. With  \\nAmazon EC2, you can stop  an instance a nd resiz e it to an instance type that has more \\nRAM, CPU, I /O, or networking capabilities. This way of scaling can eventually reach  a \\nlimit , and it is not always a  cost-efficient or highly available approach. However, it is \\nvery easy to implement and can be sufficient for many use cases especially in the short \\nterm.  \\nScaling Horizontally  \\nScaling horizontally takes place through an increase in the number of resources , such \\nas adding more hard drives to a storage array or adding more servers to support an \\napplication. This is a great way to build internet -scale applications that leverage the \\nelasticity of cloud computing. Not all architectures are designed to distribute their \\nworkload to multiple resources, so let’s examine some possible scenarios.

A session is unique data for users  that persists  \\nbetween requests while they use the application.  A stateless application is an \\napplication that does not need knowledge of previous interactions and does not store \\nsession information . For  example,  an application that, given the same input, provides \\nthe same response to any end user , is a stateless application . Stateless applic ations  \\ncan scale horizontally because  any of the available compute resources ( such as  EC2 \\ninstances  and AWS Lambda functions)  can service any request . With out stored session \\ndata, you can simply add more compute resources as needed. When that capacity is \\nno longer required, you can safely terminate those  individual resource s, after running \\ntasks have been drained. Those resources do not need to be aware of the presence of \\ntheir peers —all that is required is a way to distribute the workload to them.  \\nDistribu te Load to Multiple Nodes  \\nTo distribute the workload to multiple nodes in your environment, you can choose \\neither a push or a pull model.  \\nWith a push model , you  can use Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)  to distribute a workload. \\nELB routes incoming application requests across multiple EC2 instances. When routing \\ntraffic, a Network Load Balancer operates at layer 4 of the Open Systems \\nInterconnection (OSI) model to handle millions of requests per second. With the \\nadoption of container -based services, you can also use an  Application Load Balanc er. \\nAn Application Load Balancer  provides Layer 7 of the OSI model  and support s content -\\nbased routing of requests based on application traffic.  Alternatively, you can use \\nAmazon Route 53 to  implem ent a DNS round robin. In this case, DNS responses return \\nan IP address from a list of valid hosts in a round -robin fashion. While easy to \\nimplement, this approach does not always work well with the elasticity of cloud \\ncomputing. This is because even if yo u can set low time to live (TTL) values for your \\nDNS records, caching DNS resolvers are outside the control of Amazon Route 53 and \\nmight not always respect your settings.  \\nInstead of a load balancing solution, you can implement a pull model for \\nasynchronous , event -driven workloads. In a pull model, tasks that need to be \\nperformed or data that need s to be processed can be stored as messages in a queue \\nusing Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) or as a streaming data solution ', metadata={'source': './docs/AWS_Cloud_Best_Practices.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",

Multiple compute resources  can then pull and consume those \\nmessages, processing them in a distributed fashion.  \\nStateless Components  \\nIn practice, most applications maintain some kind of state information. For example, \\nweb applications need t o track whether a user is signed in  so that personalized content  \\ncan be presented  based on previous actions. An automated multi -step process also \\nneed s to track previous activity to decide what its next action should be. You can still \\nmake a portion of the se architectures stateless by not storing anything that needs to \\npersist for more than a single request  in the local file system . \\nFor example, web applications can use HTTP cookies to store session information ( such \\nas shopping cart  items ) in the web clien t cache . The browser passes that information \\nback to the server at each subsequent request so that the application does not need to \\nstore it. However, this approach has  two drawbacks. First, the content of the HTTP \\ncookies can be tampered with on the clien t side, so you should always treat it as \\nuntrusted data that must  be validated. Second, HTTP cookies are transmitted with \\nevery request, which means that you should keep their size to a minimum to avoid \\nunnecessary latency.  \\nConsider only storing a unique s ession identifier in a n HTTP cookie and storing more \\ndetailed user session information on the server  side. Most programming platforms \\nprovide a native session management mechanism that works this way .

It is important that you make this an \\nautomat ed and repeatable process that avoids long lead times and is not prone to \\nhuman error.  There are a few methods  to achieve this. \\nBootstrapping  \\nWhen you launch an AWS resource such as  an EC2 instance or Amazon Relational \\nDatabase  Service  (Amazon RDS) DB inst ance, you start with a default configuration. \\nYou can then execute automated bootstrapping actions , which are  scripts that install \\nsoftware or copy data to bring that resource to a particular state. You can \\nparameterize configuration details that vary betw een different environments ( such as  \\nproduction  or test) so that you can reuse the same scripts without modifications.  \\nYou can set up new EC2 instances with  user data scripts and cloud -init directives .8 You \\ncan use simple scripts  and configuration management tools such as Chef or Puppet.

Synchronous \\nreplication can also scale read capacity for queries that require the most up -to-date \\ndata (strong consistency). The drawback of synchronous replication is that the primary \\nnode is coupled to the replicas. A transaction can’t be ack nowledged before all replicas \\nhave performed the write. This can compromise performance and availability , \\nespecially in topologies that run across unreliable or high -latency network \\nconnections.

In a traditional infrastructure , you \\ntypically have a disaster recovery plan to allow failover to a distant second data center  \\nin the event of  a major disruption in the primary one.

In this scenar io, \\nyour architecture should provision excess  capacity to withstand the loss of one \\nAvailability Zone.  45 \\nMany of the higher -level services on AWS are inherently designed according to the \\nmultiple Availability Zone ( Multi -AZ) principle.

This helps  you to reduce the scope of your responsibility \\nand focus on your core competencies through the use of AWS managed services. For \\nexample, when you use services such as Amazon RDS  and Amazon ElastiCache , security \\npatches are applied automatically to your configuration settings . This not only reduces \\noperational overhead for your team, but it could also reduce your exposure to \\nvulnerabilities.  \\nReduce Privileged Access  \\nWhen your  servers are programmable resources, you get many security benefits. The \\nability to  change your servers whenever you need to  enables  you to eliminate the \\nneed for guest operating system access to production environments. If an instance \\nexperiences an issue , you can aut omatically or manually terminate and replace it. \\nHowever, before you replace instances , you should collect and centrally store log  data  \\nthat can help you recreate issues in your development environment and deploy them \\nas fixes through your continuous deplo yment process. This approach ensures that the \\nlog data assist with troubleshooting and raise awareness of security events. This is \\nparticularly important in an elastic compute environment where servers are \\ntemporary. You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to c ollect this information. Where \\nyou don’t have direct access , you can  implement services such as AWS Systems \\nManager  55 to take a unified view and automate actions on groups of resources . You \\ncan integr ate these requests with your ticketing system, so that access requests are \\ntracked and dynamically handled only after approval.   \\nAnother common security risk is the use of stored, long term credentials or service \\naccounts. In a traditional environment, ser vice accounts are often assigned long -term \\ncredentials that are stored in a configuration file. On AWS, you can instead use IAM \\nroles to grant permissions to applications running on EC2 instances through the use of \\nshort -term credentials , which  are automat ically distributed and rotated. For mobile \\napplications, you can  use Amazon Cognito to allow  client devices to access AWS \\nresources through  temporary tokens  with fine-grained permissions .

Then , when an \\nemployee leaves your organization and is removed from your organization’s identity \\ndirectory , that employee also automatically loses  access to your AWS account s. \\nSecurity as Code  \\nTraditional security frameworks, regulations, and organizational policies define \\nsecurity requirements related to items  such as firewall rules, network access controls, \\ninternal/external subnets, and operating  system hardening. You can implement these \\nin an AWS environment as well, but you now have the opportunity to capture them all \\nin a template  that defines a Golden Environment . This template is used by AWS \\nCloudFormation and deploys  your resources in alignm ent with your security policy. \\nYou can reuse security best practices among multiple projects , as a part of your \\ncontinuous integration pipeline. You can perform security testing as part of your \\nrelease cycle, and automatically discover application gaps and  drift from your security \\npolicy.  \\nAdditionally, for greater control and security, AWS CloudFormation templates can be \\nimported as products  into AWS Service Catalog .56 This allows you to  central ly manage  \\nyour  resources to support consistent governance, security, and compliance \\nrequirements, while enabling your users to quickly deploy only the approved IT \\nservices they need.

Services such as  AWS Config, Am azon Inspector, \\nand AWS Trusted Advisor continually monitor for compliance or vulnerabilities , giving \\nyou a clear overview of which IT resources are in compliance , and which are not.
